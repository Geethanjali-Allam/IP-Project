## Motivation:
* The Project will investigate Clearly about What type of dogs are put out for adoption. What type of dog breeds are put out for adoption and how to view the photos of the dog put up for adoption Using the dog URL.
## Investigative Questions:
## The Project Will carry Out the Following Questions:
* Which Type of Dogs breed name is Unknown?
* Check weather a dog with a specific Breed  Name is Present?
* How to get a dogs URL by ID?



## Approach
* Over 3,000 dogs in the United States are available for adoption, according to this statistic. We can aid these animals in locating their ideal homes by comprehending the patterns of dog travel and relocation.
Each dog's background is included in the data, along with the state where they are currently available for adoption. This can be used to comprehend the patterns of canine migration across the nation and how certain states depend on imported canines for adoption.
When use this dataset, Data only contains dogs that were available for adoption and posted on PetFinder.com.
* The Data Structures that I plan on using are dictionaries, to search the dog by its breed by its breed name. The key will be the breed name and value will be a list of strings of dog ID.
* The transformation of Data will include Use of an Accumulator where a Dictionary is used as an accumulator and then the data set is transversed and the required data is added to the accumulator. 

## Expected Results 

* The Anticipated Result include dictionary with The key will be the breed name and value will be a list of strings of dog ID.
* A list of dogs With breed names.
* string with dog URL.


## New Python Packages or Modules
